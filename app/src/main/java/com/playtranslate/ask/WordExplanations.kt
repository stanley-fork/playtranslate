/**
 * The questions asked about the words of one list: how each word is used in
 * the sentence it was read in. Every asked word has an [AskSession] of its
 * own, so a word's question lives exactly as a sentence's does (asked, the
 * service being asked, answered or refused or failed, asked again, put
 * away) and the words do not wait on one another.
 *
 * A word is named by the [key] its list gives it (its row's id), and its
 * question is kept with the [WordInSentence] it was asked about: the owner
 * says which questions still stand ([retain]) by what each row is now.
 *
 * [onChange] hears of a question whose state moved by itself: its service
 * was named, its answer or its failure came. It never hears of anything
 * the owner did here ([ask] apart, whose question starts moving at once):
 * a question put away by [close], [retain] or [clear] goes back to where it
 * started, which is no move anyone is told of, so the owner is not called
 * back in the middle of its own change and redraws when it is done. What
 * is put away leaves nothing running: its request and its listener end.
 *
 * The questions run on [scope] and end with it. Main thread only, like the
 * list it serves.
