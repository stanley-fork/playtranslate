/**
 * The word card's Definition field, as DATA. Every word-card send — the
 * review sheet and the hold-to-create one-tap alike — describes what it
 * wants rendered and lets [sendWordCard] fetch the structured-glossary
 * payload and emit the markup, the way [sendSentenceCard] already owns the
 * sentence card's words table. One producer: the sheet cannot ship a styled
 * Definition the one-tap silently lacks. (That drift is what this replaced:
 * the styled fetch and the gl-sc builder were private to the sheet, so a
 * hold-created word card stayed on the flattened text no matter what the
 * lens or the detail page had just shown.)
 *
 * The sheet fills the curation fields from its editor state; one-tap passes
 * the bare [entry] its surface already held and leaves them at their
 * "nothing removed, nothing translated" defaults — so for an unedited entry
 * both paths emit byte-identical HTML.
