 * Sentence-card content for Anki review (Original, Translation, Words,
 * Screenshot) as a host-agnostic view class — extracted from
 * its former fragment host so the SAME card editor renders inside the
 * fragment-hosted review sheets AND the floating workspace's editor page.
 * Each section renders as a grouped [PtGroupCard] with the design-system
 * header on top, matching the Settings / Word Detail rhythm.
 *
 * Words always ship with the card unless the user hides them with the
 * eye on the word's row. Tapping the row toggles **target** state — target
 * words are highlighted on the rendered card front (the HTML builder
 * reads [selectedWords]) and carry their audio switch inside the row.
 *
 * [args] is the launch-state Bundle (built by [buildArgs]) and is the
 * MUTABLE state carrier the fragment flow has always used —
 * [applyTranslation]/[applyWords] write back into it so a re-created
 * fragment rebuilds from current state. The fragment shell passes its own
 * `arguments` so those semantics are unchanged; the workspace page passes
 * a fresh bundle it never re-reads.
 *
 * Lifetime: [buildInto] once, [release] exactly once when the host view
 * tree goes away — with the host's own teardown-finality decision for the
 * game-audio snapshot file. [scope] must be cancelled by the host.
