/**
 * The results page's Words card — the rows a settled word lookup renders
 * (reading, definitions, frequency, pitch, the hidden-words eye), with the
 * deck badges, the per-row speak action, the hidden-words ordering + in-place
 * re-stub, and the card's own eye (the persisted hide-words-section pref).
 * Host-agnostic: the in-app [TranslationResultFragment] and the floating
 * workspace's [WorkspaceSentencePage] both render through here, so the list
 * can't drift between the two surfaces. Views are found from [root]
 * (`section_words.xml`'s ids). The header is a [SectionHeaderRow] like the
 * source and target sections': its eye is a pinned [HeaderAction], and its
 * label carries the row count while rows are on screen ([syncLabel]).
 *
 * The rows are a [WordRowList] in [container]: ONE definitions document,
 * the pack's definitions and the imported dictionaries' alike drawn by its
 * page, with the deck badges and each row's speak spinner kept by the list.
 * It is the one list whose rows take two columns where its page is at
 * least 560px wide ([DefinitionsDocument.DocTheme.twoColumnsWhenWide]), as
 * the card is at full width on a landscape screen.
 * This binder adds what is the card's own: the hidden-words eye as the
 * rows' second button, the hidden-last ordering, and the card's visibility.
 * The document feeds its rows on demand and fetches their structured
 * content itself, under the language the lookup ran in
 * ([WordLookupsState.Settled.definitionLang]).
 *
 * Hidden words, the rules pinned by the store's tests: a fresh list draws
 * visible words first and hidden words last, each group in lookup order,
 * and only when the language's set had LOADED before the render
 * ([hiddenOrderApplied]); a list drawn before the load is provisional, and
 * the load's revision bump re-renders it instead of re-stubbing in place,
 * so the first real render is ordered like any other. A toggle never moves
 * a row: [applyHiddenState] re-stubs rows in place. The eye tap writes the
 * opposite of the state the row was SHOWING (the row the page reported the
 * tap on), never a fresh store read — the icon is what the user acted on.
 *
 * The card itself has two hide sources, and [isHidden] is their union:
 * the persisted pref ([Prefs.hideWordsSection]) and a session-only live
 * auto-hide ([setLiveMode]). The rows are lazy: the VM settles only the
 * analysis ([WordLookupsState.Analyzed], drawn like Loading) and builds the
 * rows when this card asks through [onRowsWanted], which it does whenever
 * it is effectively visible. A hidden card therefore costs no dictionary
 * lookups, no deck queries and no page: it holds no document view, so it
 * neither loads the WebView nor pins its render process. A
 * [WordLookupsState.Settled] that lands while the card is hidden (the rows
 * were requested, then the user hid the card before they settled) is kept
 * and drawn when the card is shown: the lookup was already paid, and the
 * next text starts lazy again.
 *
 * Rows are never shown as an empty card. A page takes a moment to draw the
 * rows it is handed (longer when it has to load first), and the card around
 * a page that has drawn nothing is a hairline. So the loading line is up for
 * the whole wait, whatever it is a wait for ([syncWaiting]): while a lookup
 * runs, and while the card has rows its page has not drawn ([rowsUndrawn]),
 * which is where a lookup's line stays until its rows are on screen and
 * what a card revealed with its rows already looked up shows meanwhile.
 * The wait ends without rows when none will be drawn: the page's notice
 * stands in, or its first rows could not be built, and then the card is as
 * empty as the page. One wait has no line: a page that had drawn its rows
 * and lost its renderer is blank at its old height until the new one has
 * drawn them, as on every surface ([WordRowList.awaitsFirstLayout]).
 *
 * A reveal draws the card first and takes its page after ([startPage]):
 * building a WebView holds the main thread (most of a second for a process's
 * first one on a slow phone), and a card that took its page inside the tap
 * would open, loading line and all, only once that was over. The page of a
 * card revealed while its lookup runs is started then too, so it loads
 * beside the lookup and not after it.
 *
 * Live mode auto-hides the card for its whole session: a dual-screen live
 * session lands a result on every panel emission, and the list is rarely
 * read there. The eye reveals it for the rest of that session without
 * touching the pref; hiding it again is an ordinary, persisted hide. The
 * live flag lives on this binder, so it is per view: a page recreated
 * during live mode is seeded with the running state and starts auto-hidden
 * again.
