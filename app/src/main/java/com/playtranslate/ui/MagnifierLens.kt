/**
 * Floating magnifier lens shown while the user drags on a JP/ZH/Latin token
 * and persists post-release as the dictionary surface.
 *
 * Visual structure (matches design handoff in
 * ~/playtranslate/design_handoff_magnifying_lens):
 *  - A rounded card (16dp radius, BWI_PANEL #15181B, 1dp white-16% border)
 *    holds the zoom / loading / definitions body.
 *  - A coral pill (accent-themed) overhangs the card's top edge by half its
 *    height. It carries the word, a hairline divider, and the reading while
 *    the lens is a magnifier or is loading. Once a definition row shows,
 *    the row names the word and the pill is hidden, and the space it took
 *    (the overhang above the card, the padding under it) goes back to the
 *    definitions.
 *  - A 10dp triangular arrow drops from the card's bottom edge (or rises
 *    from the top when the lens flips below the finger).
 *
 * Render modes:
 *  - **ZOOM** (drag): zoomed pixels + crosshair fill the card body. The pill
 *    keeps showing the currently-detected token.
 *  - **LOADING**: spinner + "Looking up…" in the body while OCR/lookup
 *    resolve. Pill shows the word being resolved.
 *  - **DEFINITIONS** (drag-preview AND sticky): the body is ONE word list
 *    ([WordRowList], the list the Words card and the dictionary search
 *    draw) whose rows are the lens's sections: the looked-up word alone, or
 *    with a related unit (word + containing phrase on the space-delimited
 *    surfaces, fused expression + member words and other entries on JA, the
 *    longer unit on top), each the app's one word row with its own Speak
 *    and Add-to-Anki buttons, then the "Load more" row when sections are
 *    held back.
 *
 * Tap routing:
 *  - The page is the authority on what a tap in the body hit: a link
 *    navigates (handed to the browser), a button is its row's action
 *    ([onSpeak], [onAnkiTap], a held Anki button [onAnkiLongPress]),
 *    anything else is its row's tap, [onOpenTap] for the tapped/primary
 *    unit's row, [onSecondaryOpenTap] for a related one's, [onLoadMoreTap]
 *    for the "Load more" row. A row's chevron is purely a visual cue (a
 *    section's `opens` withholds it, and the tap, when the caller has
 *    nothing to open into).
 *  - While the lens is loading, a tap on the card or the pill fires
 *    [onOpenTap].
 *  - The arrow strip and the pill's overhang outside the card are
 *    non-interactive.

         *     animated Word→Placeholder toward the wide idle width;
