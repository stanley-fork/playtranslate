/**
 * A list of looked-up words drawn as ONE definitions document: what the
 * results page's Words card, the dictionary search, the word page's "Words"
 * and "Other matches" sections and the lens all share. Each word of type
 * [T] is the one word row ([DefRow.Word]), with a speak button, the host's
 * second button, and a tap that opens the word; [describe] says what a row
 * shows of its word, and an optional footer is a one-line action under the
 * rows (the lens's "Load more").
 *
 * It keeps the state a row is drawn from beyond the row itself (the deck
 * cache, which rows are speaking, which of a row's dictionaries the user has
 * shut, what was asked about a row's word and what came of it) and
 * [publish] maps it all to rows. Every
 * change ends in [publish], and the document patches only the rows whose
 * value changed, so a deck badge, a spinner or the host's own change (a
 * word hidden) never rebuilds the list.
 *
 * The list holds a page only while it has rows and is [shown]: a hidden or
 * empty list neither loads the WebView nor keeps its render process.
