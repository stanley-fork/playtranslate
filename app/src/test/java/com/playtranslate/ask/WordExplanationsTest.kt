/**
 * [WordExplanations]: the questions asked about the words of one list, one
 * [AskSession] per asked word.
 *  - a word's question is put with [AskPrompts.build] for an
 *    [AskQuestion.Word] of that word, about its own sentence, and its state
 *    is its session's: asking (the service named), answered, failed, asked
 *    again;
 *  - the words do not wait on one another, and one's answer is never
 *    another's;
 *  - the owner hears of a state that moved by itself, once per move, and of
 *    nothing it did itself: a question put away (closed, not retained,
 *    cleared) is cancelled, writes nothing afterwards, does not call back
 *    and leaves nothing running;
 *  - [WordExplanations.retain] keeps a question by its key and by the word
 *    in its sentence that it was asked about.
 *
 * Pure JVM, on an unconfined scope like [AskSessionTest]: every state lands
 * inside the call that causes it.
